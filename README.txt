This algorithm is designed to run on the PlatEMO platform. Please first download the PlatEMO framework, then copy the algorithm folder into the Algorithms/Multi-objective optimization/ directory under the root of PlatEMO, i.e.:

PlatEMO-master/Algorithms/Multi-objective optimization/YourAlgorithmFolderName

After completing this step, you can launch the PlatEMO platform to run the algorithm for optimization experiments.
